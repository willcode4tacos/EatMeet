# EatMeet
- A Javascript based application that allows users to search for restaurants around them and nominate their choice of restaurant for a vote among their group of friends to decide where they would be dining.

- The application solves the issue of indecisiveness, when it comes to group dining, by allowing users to communicate their prefernces via the application and also providing a voting tool for them to reach a consensus. The app also pin points all the nominated restaurants on a map so users can see where each nomination is located. Therefore, eliminating the need for the often undersirable back and forth communication between a group when trying to decide where to dine.

- Skills employed in this project:
     - HTML
     - Bootstrap
     - CSS
     - Modals
     - Javascript
     - AJAX
     - Firebase
     - API manipulation
     

- The working application has the follwoing features:
     - Search capability using FourSquare API
     - Tracking total numer of users who are interacting with the application data base in real time using Firebase
     - Real time nominations using Firebase
     - Live voting using Fire Base
     - Pinning all nominations to a map for users to see where they are located using Google Maps API

- Future Development Ideas:
     - Bill split calculator
     - Zelle/Venmo based payment feature to split the tab
     - Tip calculator
     - Map capability that generates distance to the restaurant and map out the route
